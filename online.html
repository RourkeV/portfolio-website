            Before we all set off to travel around the world, the program began slowly with a series of online classes that introduced us to the expectations and intended outcomes of the minor. During this period, we were introduced not only to the other students participating in the program but also to the lecturers who would be guiding us throughout the experience.

                <h3>Introduction to Subjects</h3>
                <p>
                    We began the project gradually, starting the week with introductions to the five subjects that would form the foundation of the minor. 
                    The sessions were brief, providing only an overview of each subject, and I found it somewhat challenging to stay fully engaged during the online classes. 
                    However, the excitement started to bui;d as we came to understand what we where going to learn in the months ahead and how each subject would contribute to the development of our main project.

                <h3>First Assignment & Project Group</h3>
                <p>
                    For the first assignment, I was placed into a project group with fellow students.
                    The purpose of this task was to allow us to become better acquainted, explore how we function as a team, and begin establishing a group dynamic.
                    Although it was a relatively simple exercise, it helped me figure out how my grouped worked and what my role within the team was going to be for the next few months.
                    Personally, I found it a challenge as I find that introductions and interactions over the internet make it difficult to get to know someone.

                <h3>Introduction to Main Project</h3>
                <p>
                    We were then introduced to the main project of the global minor, which forms the central focus of the program.
                    During this introduction, I gained insight into the project's goals, expectations, and its relevance within a real-world context.
                    This not only helped me to understand the broader impact of our teams but it also gave me a clearer sense of what is to come and how I could contribute to the overall outcome.

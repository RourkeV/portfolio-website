                <p>Pretoria was our three-week sprint to finish strong. We finally got the sensors into Hartbeespoort Dam, watched what actually worked, and found all the messy bits we needed to tighten up.</p>

                <p>By the end of the three weeks, the sensor stack was solid, the story made sense, and we had enough real-world proof to feel confident about the handoff.</p>

            <div class="section-content">
                <p>Pretoria felt familiar yet new - I’d only ever passed through, never stayed. This time I actually lived in it: morning commutes to the dam, quick bites between fixes, and sunsets that made the long days feel lighter.</p>

                        <p>We got closer fast - debugging on the dam wall, swapping roles when someone hit a wall, and cheering when the data finally flowed.</p>

                        <p>Weekend sprints: Cape Town’s sea breeze and hikes, then Margate’s lazy swims. Each trip reset our brains before diving back in.</p>

                    <p>The Pilanesberg day trip is going to stick with me - three leopard sightings in one go felt like the universe giving us a nod after a chaotic week.</p>

                <p>Leaving Pretoria meant saying goodbye to the team, the dam, and the rhythm we had built. We left tired, proud, and ready for whatever the next campus threw at us.</p>

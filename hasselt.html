            <div class="section-content">
                <p>The ML/AI module at Hasselt was a deep dive into machine learning and neural networks, moving me beyond theory into confident application. Meeting our lecturers and classmates, I was struck by the diversity of perspectives and the welcoming atmosphere. Our studies focused on the fundamentals of machine learning and neural networks, and I found myself challenged to think critically and creatively.</p>

                    <p>The teaching style at the Belgian campus was both familiar and refreshingly different, prompting me to evaluate my own learning habits and adapt to new expectations. We tackled three assignments in week two, applying machine learning theory to practical problems. Working closely with classmates, I saw how diverse backgrounds and approaches can spark creative solutions.</p>

            <div class="section-content">
                <p>Beyond the classroom, Hasselt offered countless opportunities for cultural exploration and personal growth. My first days were a blend of excitement and challenge. Settling into new accommodation, I was immediately faced with the unexpected task of tracking down my lost laptop bag, a process that introduced me to the Belgian train system and the realities of navigating local bureaucracy. These early hurdles were more than logistical; they were my first lessons in resilience and adaptation.</p>

                <p>As my time in Hasselt came to an end, I traveled back to South Africa with a sense of accomplishment, gratitude, and excitement for what comes next. I realized that informal interactions often lead to the most meaningful cultural exchanges. These adventures reminded me that growth often comes from embracing discomfort and seeking out new experiences. Comparing the systems here to those in South Africa, I began to appreciate the subtle differences in how people approach everyday problems. The lessons from Hasselt will continue to shape how I learn, collaborate, and approach new opportunities in the future.</p>

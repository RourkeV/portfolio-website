            <div class="section-content">
                <p>During my stay in Lleida, Spain, I experienced an intensive focus on UX/UI design, combining theoretical knowledge with practical application through hands-on projects and creative experimentation.</p>
                
                <div class="resource-box">
                    <h4><i class="fas fa-folder-open"></i> Project Resources</h4>
                    <p>Access my complete portfolio of project documents, presentations, and design materials:</p>

                    </a>
                </div>

                <p>I was introduced to advanced UX/UI design principles, user research methodologies, and prototyping tools such as Figma and Adobe XD. This allowed me to understand the complete design process from ideation to final implementation.</p>
                
                <div class="key-points">
                    <div class="key-point">
                        <h4><i class="fas fa-mobile-alt"></i> Main Design Project</h4>
                        <p>Much of my academic focus centered on a comprehensive UX/UI project where I conducted user research, created wireframes, developed high-fidelity prototypes, and performed usability testing.</p>

                        <h4><i class="fas fa-users"></i> User-Centered Design</h4>
                        <p>Through this process, I developed stronger user research and empathy skills. I learned how to conduct interviews, create user personas, and design with accessibility in mind.</p>

                </div>
                
                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <p>Interactions with local design studios and professionals gave me insight into the Spanish design industry and how cultural context influences design decisions and user expectations.</p>
                </div>
                
                <p>Classes on design systems and information architecture helped me understand how to create consistent, scalable design solutions that work across multiple platforms and devices.</p>
                
                <p>Importantly, my academic experience was not limited to technical design skills. Classes on cultural aspects of design highlighted how visual communication is shaped by cultural contexts. This made me realize that effective design requires cultural awareness and the ability to adapt solutions for diverse audiences.</p>
                
                <p>Overall, I would describe my academic experience as practice-based and iterative, combining design theory, user research, prototyping, and intercultural design thinking.</p>

            <div class="section-content">
                <p>Equally important to my academic growth has been the intercultural learning I experienced, both in the classroom and through day-to-day life in Catalonia, Spain.</p>
                
                <div class="key-points">

                        <p>In formal settings, I participated in Catalan language classes and cultural workshops, where I learned about the region's unique history, traditions, and identity distinct from broader Spanish culture.</p>

                        <h4><i class="fas fa-utensils"></i> Culinary Experiences</h4>
                        <p>Food became a major point of cultural exchange, from traditional Catalan dishes like pa amb tom√†quet and escalivada to experiencing the local market culture and Spanish dining traditions.</p>

                </div>
                
                <p>These experiences challenged me to think critically about regional identities and helped me appreciate the complexity of Spanish and Catalan culture.</p>
                
                <p>Beyond the classroom, I immersed myself in local traditions. I experienced Catalan festivals, explored historic sites, and learned about the significance of local customs and celebrations.</p>
                
                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <p>Exploring different parts of Catalonia deepened my cultural learning. Visiting Barcelona, Tarragona, and the Pyrenees gave me a sense of Catalan history, landscapes, and architectural heritage. Walking through medieval towns, Roman ruins, and mountain trails helped me understand the region's rich cultural diversity.</p>

                <p>Working in a multicultural team was another key intercultural experience. I learned to navigate different communication styles, design preferences, and work approaches. Our group activities (whether through exploring Lleida, enjoying tapas together, or collaborative design sessions) helped build stronger connections across cultures.</p>

                <p>Looking back, I feel that my intercultural experience has given me greater cultural sensitivity and design thinking skills. I have become more adaptable, more aware of how culture influences design decisions, and more comfortable working in diverse international creative environments.</p>

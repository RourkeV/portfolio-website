            <div class="section-content">
                <p>During my stay in Lleida, Spain, I experienced an intensive focus on UX/UI design, combining theoretical knowledge with practical application through hands-on projects and creative experimentation.</p>
                
                <div class="resource-box">
                    <h4><i class="fas fa-folder-open"></i> Project Resources</h4>
                    <p>Access my complete portfolio of project documents, presentations, and design materials:</p>

                </div>

                <p>I was introduced to advanced UX/UI design principles and user research methodologies, using tools such as Figma and RuxAi. This allowed me to understand the complete design process from ideation, to user testing, and finally implementation.</p>

                        <h4><i class="fas fa-mobile-alt"></i> IoT Interface Design Project</h4>
                        <p>Much of my academic focus centered on creating a front-end prototype for an IoT interface. I developed user profiles and scenarios, conducted iterative user testing through RuxAi, and implemented improvements based on feedback received.</p>
                        
                        <h5>UX/UI Principles Learned</h5>
                        <p>Throughout the project, I mastered fundamental UX/UI principles including:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>User Research:</strong> Creating detailed user personas and journey maps</li>
                            <li><strong>Wireframing & Prototyping:</strong> Developing interactive prototypes in Figma</li>
                            <li><strong>Usability Testing:</strong> Conducting tests with RuxAi and implementing iterative improvements</li>
                            <li><strong>Design Systems:</strong> Maintaining consistency across interface components</li>
                            <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Ensuring designs work for diverse user groups</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4><i class="fas fa-water"></i> Water Sanitation Field Visit</h4>
                        <p>We visited a water sanitation plant in Lleida where the director presented their activities and future projects. We explored innovative solutions including hydrogen-fueled vehicles and organic waste disposal processes, connecting our IoT project to real-world environmental challenges.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                
                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <p>Working with Spanish students on our collaborative project gave me insight into different design approaches and communication styles. This cross-cultural collaboration enriched our final prototype and taught me the importance of cultural context in design decisions.</p>
                </div>
                
                <p>Classes on design theory helped me understand how to create consistent, scalable design solutions that work across multiple platforms and devices. The iterative nature of our project—constantly testing and refining based on user feedback—gave me hands-on experience with the full UX design cycle.</p>
                
                <p>Importantly, my academic experience was not limited to technical design skills. Understanding Catalan culture through visits to historical sites like the Lleida Cathedral helped me appreciate how cultural context shapes visual communication and user expectations.</p>
                
                <p>Overall, I would describe my academic experience as practice-based and iterative, combining design theory, user research, prototyping, and intercultural design thinking in a real-world project context.</p>

                        <p>After saying goodbye to friends at the Blue Collar Stayokay hostel in the Netherlands, I traveled to Barcelona and then by train to Lleida—a beautiful 3-hour journey through Catalan countryside. My accommodation in Lleida was the best of the entire trip, providing a comfortable base for exploration.</p>

                    <p>My Saturday in Barcelona was unforgettable. Starting at the iconic Sagrada Família, I walked through the city discovering tourist destinations and stumbled upon a magical moment—a local band playing outside a church where locals invited strangers to dance traditional dances. After trying paella and other Spanish dishes, I made my way through crowds and festivals to the beach, passing the Christopher Columbus statue pointing out to sea. Swimming in the Mediterranean and relaxing on the crowded beach was a perfect end to an adventurous day.</p>

                        <p>I immersed myself in local culture by attending multiple festivals in Lleida, including a memorable "boat ride" experience. I visited a bar on a hilltop next to a castle, participated in an exciting Wild West themed escape room, and witnessed a powerful protest about the Israel-Palestine conflict, highlighting the social consciousness of the community.</p>

                    <p>Our departure was an adventure itself—one student almost lost his bag on a train, we nearly missed our connection at the airport, but with help from fellow students at our next accommodation, we successfully made it to Austria. These travel challenges taught me adaptability and the importance of staying calm under pressure.</p>
                </div>
                
                <p>Looking back, my intercultural experience in Spain gave me greater cultural sensitivity and global awareness. From exploring Barcelona's vibrant streets to understanding Lleida's historical significance, from participating in local festivals to working with international teams—each experience deepened my appreciation for cultural diversity and strengthened my ability to work effectively in multicultural environments.</p>

                <p>During my stay in the Netherlands, I have experienced a balance between theoretical learning, hands-on experimentation, and project-based collaboration.</p>

                </div>

                <p>I was introduced to immersive technologies such as VR, AR, and MR devices, which I could test and connect directly to my main project. For example, I explored how AR could be used to visualize water quality data, which allowed me to see the link between abstract concepts and real-world applications.</p>

                        <p>Much of my academic focus has been on the Hartbeespoort Dam water quality challenge. I worked on a research document, developed and delivered presentations, and contributed to paper prototypes of potential solutions.</p>

                        <p>Through this process, I also developed stronger research and systems thinking skills. I learned how to frame meaningful research questions, analyze current activities, and organize findings.</p>

                    <p>Interactions with external institutions, such as the water management department, and exposure to projects like a mobile water-monitoring drone, gave me insight into how professionals in the Netherlands apply theory to practice.</p>

                <p>Classes on the logical structures of input–process–output helped me connect my project to broader systems thinking approaches.</p>
                
                <p>Importantly, my academic experience was not limited to technical learning. Classes on cultural differences highlighted how solutions are shaped by human and social contexts. This made me realize that developing technical solutions requires cultural sensitivity and adaptability, especially when working in diverse, international teams.</p>
                
                <p>Overall, I would describe my academic experience as problem-based and interdisciplinary, combining environmental research, immersive technology, and intercultural competence.</p>

                <p>Equally important to my academic growth has been the intercultural learning I experienced, both in the classroom and through day-to-day life in the Netherlands.</p>

                        <p>In formal settings, I participated in classes on cultural differences, where I reflected on how people from different cultures approach conflict, problem-solving, and teamwork.</p>

                        <p>Food became a major point of cultural exchange, from Dutch-inspired lunches and traditional snacks like stroopwafels to everyday experiences like trying McDonald's in the Netherlands.</p>

                </div>
                
                <p>These sessions challenged me to think critically about my own cultural assumptions and helped me work more effectively with my group.</p>
                
                <p>Beyond the classroom, I immersed myself in Dutch culture in more informal ways. I was also introduced to Dutch Christmas traditions, which gave me a glimpse into local customs and celebrations.</p>
                
                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <p>Exploring different parts of the Netherlands deepened my cultural learning. Visiting Amsterdam, Roermond, and Swalmen gave me a sense of Dutch history, landscapes, and city life. Walking through forests, farmland, and even joining a yacht trip helped me understand the close relationship between Dutch people, their environment, and their long tradition of water management.</p>

                <p>Working in a multicultural team was another key intercultural experience. I learned to navigate different working styles, perspectives, and expectations. Our group bonding (whether through exploring Eindhoven, playing pool, or simply relaxing together) helped build stronger connections across cultures and created a more supportive environment for collaboration.</p>

                <p>Looking back, I feel that my intercultural experience has given me greater global competence. I have become more adaptable, more aware of cultural differences, and more comfortable working in diverse international settings.</p>

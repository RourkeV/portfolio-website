            <div class="section-content">
                <p>During my stay in Lleida, Spain, I experienced an intensive focus on UX/UI design, combining theoretical knowledge with practical application through hands-on projects and creative experimentation.</p>

                </div>

                <p>I was introduced to advanced UX/UI design principles and user research methodologies, using tools such as Figma and RuxAi. This allowed me to understand the complete design process from ideation, to user testing, and finally implementation.</p>

                        <h4><i class="fas fa-mobile-alt"></i> IoT Interface Design Project</h4>
                        <p>Much of my academic focus centered on creating a front-end prototype for an IoT interface. I developed user profiles and scenarios, conducted iterative user testing through RuxAi, and implemented improvements based on feedback received.</p>
                        
                        <h5>UX/UI Principles Learned</h5>
                        <p>Throughout the project, I mastered fundamental UX/UI principles including:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>User Research:</strong> Creating detailed user personas and journey maps</li>
                            <li><strong>Wireframing & Prototyping:</strong> Developing interactive prototypes in Figma</li>
                            <li><strong>Usability Testing:</strong> Conducting tests with RuxAi and implementing iterative improvements</li>
                            <li><strong>Design Systems:</strong> Maintaining consistency across interface components</li>
                            <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Ensuring designs work for diverse user groups</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>We visited a water sanitation plant in Lleida where the director presented their activities and future projects. We explored innovative solutions including hydrogen-fueled vehicles and organic waste disposal processes, connecting our IoT project to real-world environmental challenges.</p>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <p>Working with Spanish students on our collaborative project gave me insight into different design approaches and communication styles. This cross-cultural collaboration enriched our final prototype and taught me the importance of cultural context in design decisions.</p>
                </div>
                
                <p>Classes on design theory helped me understand how to create consistent, scalable design solutions that work across multiple platforms and devices. The iterative nature of our project—constantly testing and refining based on user feedback—gave me hands-on experience with the full UX design cycle.</p>
                
                <p>Importantly, my academic experience was not limited to technical design skills. Understanding Catalan culture through visits to historical sites like the Lleida Cathedral helped me appreciate how cultural context shapes visual communication and user expectations.</p>
                
                <p>Overall, I would describe my academic experience as practice-based and iterative, combining design theory, user research, prototyping, and intercultural design thinking in a real-world project context.</p>

            <div class="section-content">
                <p>My time in Spain was honestly one of the best parts of the entire minor. Beyond just the UX/UI work, I got to experience a completely different culture that challenged a lot of my assumptions and taught me so much about working with people from different backgrounds.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Understanding My Own Cultural Lens:</strong> I realized how much my South African background shapes the way I work and communicate—things I thought were just "normal" are actually pretty cultural</li>
                        <li><strong>Adapting How I Communicate:</strong> I'm pretty direct when I communicate, but I learned to dial it back and read between the lines more, especially when working with the Spanish students</li>
                        <li><strong>Getting the Catalan Identity Thing:</strong> This was eye-opening—Catalonia isn't just "Spain." There's real history and politics behind regional identity that you need to respect</li>
                        <li><strong>Building Cultural Empathy:</strong> Just being genuinely curious about why people do things differently (like eating dinner at 10 PM!) opened up so many conversations and learning moments</li>
                        <li><strong>Getting Comfortable with Uncertainty:</strong> Spanish culture is way more flexible with time and plans than I was used to—learning to roll with it was tough but valuable</li>

                        <p>After saying goodbye to my friends at the hostel in the Netherlands, I took a train through the most beautiful Catalan countryside to Lleida. Honestly, my accommodation there was the best I had during the whole trip so far — finally, a proper comfortable place!</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Reality Check:</strong> The cultural adjustment hit me pretty quickly. Dinner at 9 or 10 PM? That took some getting used to. People were way less direct in how they communicated, and the whole daily rhythm was different with afternoon siestas and late-night everything. It made me realize how much I took my own "normal" routines for granted. Learning to adapt and be flexible became key.</p>

                        <p>I found the best burger of my entire trip at a Venezuelan restaurant (which says something about Spain's diverse food scene), tried real paella in Barcelona, had my first sangria, and even stumbled upon this weird banana burger.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>What I Learned:</strong> Food in Spain isn't just about eating—it's social. I picked up on this concept called <em>sobremesa</em>, which is basically lingering at the table after eating just to chat. At first, I was like "why are we still sitting here?" but then I got it—relationships matter more than rushing to the next thing. Embracing those late dinners and learning to slow down taught me a lot about different cultural values.</p>

                    <h3><i class="fas fa-map-marked-alt"></i> That Barcelona Weekend</h3>
                    <p>Saturday in Barcelona was amazing. Started at the Sagrada Família (which is just incredible in person), then walked around the city. The coolest moment? This local band was playing outside a church, and locals just started pulling people from the crowd to teach them traditional dances.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Culture Lesson:</strong> watching everyone dancing taught me something important about Spanish culture—there's this openness and willingness to include strangers in celebrations. Where I'm from, people might be more reserved in public spaces, but here it was all about community and having fun together. Stepping out of my comfort zone was uncomfortable but totally worth it.</p>
                    
                    <p>Later, I tried more Spanish food and made my way through festivals to the beach, passing the Christopher Columbus statue pointing out to sea. The beach was PACKED, zero personal space. Everyone's just comfortable being close, talking loud, having a good time. Different attitude toward privacy and personal space than what I'm used to, but I got into it.</p>

                        <p>I explored Lleida's cathedral on the hill and learned about medieval history. My morning runs past the castle at sunrise were peaceful and gave me time to think (and take photos).</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Big Realization:</strong> Learning about Catalan history made me understand that you can't just say "Spanish culture" and call it a day. Catalonia has its own language, traditions, and complicated political history. This taught me not to make sweeping generalizations—I started asking "Is this Spanish or Catalan?". Cultural sensitivity means recognizing complexity.</p>

                        <p><strong>What It Taught Me:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Actually participating (not just tourist-watching) makes a huge difference in understanding culture</li>
                            <li>Seeing the protest was eye-opening—Spanish people are really engaged with global issues and aren't shy about speaking up. I watched respectfully and learned about civic engagement and freedom of expression</li>
                            <li>The escape room with international friends showed me how people from different cultures approach problem-solving differently under pressure</li>

                    <p>Working closely with Spanish students on our IoT interface project was perhaps the most significant intercultural learning experience. Daily interactions revealed important cultural differences in work approaches:</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Reading Between the Lines:</strong> Spanish communication is more indirect and relationship-based compared to my direct "just say it" style. I had to pay way more attention to tone, body language, and context instead of just taking words at face value.</li>
                        
                        <li><strong>Group Decisions > Individual Moves:</strong> I noticed decisions were more about getting everyone on board rather than someone taking charge. This taught me the value of consensus and patience—sometimes taking longer to get buy-in means better outcomes.</li>
                        
                        <li><strong>Hierarchy and Decision-Making:</strong> I observed more <em>collectivist decision-making</em> patterns where group consensus was valued over individual initiative. This taught me patience and the value of building group buy-in.</li>
                        
                        <li><strong>Conflict Resolution:</strong> When disagreements arose about design choices, I noticed Spanish teammates preferred indirect conflict resolution, maintaining harmony over confrontation. I learned to frame feedback more diplomatically and focus on relationship preservation.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p><strong>How I Adapted:</strong> I started doing things differently—like beginning meetings with casual chat instead of jumping straight to work, treating lunch breaks as important social time, and learning to pick up on indirect feedback. Basically practicing what they call "cultural intelligence"—watching, asking questions, and adjusting my behavior accordingly.</p>

                <p>Hanging out with other global minor students from different countries was awesome too. Morning runs, late-night festival adventures, working together—it all built this really supportive international community. We created our own shared culture that respected everyone's backgrounds instead of one way being "right."</p>
                
                <div class="key-point">
                    <h4><i class="fas fa-route"></i> Journey to Austria: Crisis Management Across Cultures</h4>
                    <p>Our departure was an adventure itself—one student almost lost his bag on a train, we nearly missed our connection at the airport, but with help from fellow students at our next accommodation, we successfully made it to Austria.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Stress + Different Cultures = Interesting:</strong> When things got stressful, people reacted differently. Some got more emotional and expressive, others stayed super calm. I learned not to judge these different responses and just focus on solving the problem together. The cool part? Despite our cultural differences, we pulled together because we'd built trust over the weeks.</p>

                    <p><strong>Before Lleida:</strong> I had limited experience with Southern European cultures, tended toward task-focused rather than relationship-focused approaches, and had unconscious assumptions about "professional" behavior based on my own cultural context.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>After Spain, I Can Now:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Recognize when people have different attitudes toward time and deadlines—and adapt to it</li>
                        <li>Pick up on indirect communication and read between the lines</li>
                        <li>Balance getting work done with building actual relationships with teammates</li>
                        <li>Not generalize about cultures (like understanding Catalan ≠ Spanish)</li>
                        <li>Ask questions instead of assuming I understand</li>
                        <li>Apply cultural intelligence: stay motivated to learn, actually understand the culture, plan how to adapt, and change my behavior accordingly</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                
                <p><strong>Final Thoughts:</strong> Looking back, Spain taught me that intercultural competence isn't about everyone becoming the same or eliminating differences. It's about learning to bridge those differences, staying curious, and seeing diversity as valuable rather than problematic.</p>
                
                <p>Most importantly, I learned that <em>intercultural competence is not about eliminating differences or becoming the same</em>—it's about developing the skills to bridge differences, maintain curiosity, and create value from diversity. The discomfort I felt when adapting to Spanish time concepts or communication styles was not a problem to solve, but a signal that I was growing beyond my cultural comfort zone. This mindset shift—embracing discomfort as growth—is perhaps the most valuable skill I gained from my time in Catalonia.</p>

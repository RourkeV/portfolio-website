            <div class="section-content">
                <p>Our lecturer, Volker Christian, led the module with contagious enthusiasm and deep knowledge of IoT.</p>
                <p>We built a full end‑to‑end pipeline:
                    data is transmitted by a LoRaWAN device to a local gateway; the gateway forwards to The Things Network (TTN);
                    from TTN, we use MQTT to pull the data onto a Raspberry Pi, and then forward it to a front‑end dashboard for live visualization.</p>

                    <div class="key-point">
                        <h4><i class="fas fa-wifi"></i> Week 1 — Connectivity + Architecture</h4>
                        <p>Configured the LoRaWAN device and established the link to The Things Network.
                           We were introduced to the full IoT architecture we’d use to collect and visualize sensor data.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="key-point">
                        <h4><i class="fas fa-database"></i> Week 2 — Data Flow + Storage</h4>
                        <p>Set up a database to store incoming sensor readings. Implemented MQTT subscriptions from TTN on the Raspberry Pi and persisted the data reliably.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="key-point">
                        <h4><i class="fas fa-thermometer-half"></i> Week 3 — Sensor Build + Dashboard</h4>
                        <p>Assembled the physical sensor device: LoRaWAN antenna/device, GPS, TDS, pH, temperature, and turbidity sensors, driven by an ESP microcontroller.
                           Ensured the dashboard reflected the live data streams end‑to‑end.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <p>Outcome: a complete pipeline — LoRaWAN device → Gateway → TTN → Raspberry Pi (MQTT) → Database → Front‑end dashboard — demonstrated during our final presentation.</p>
                </div>

                <h3 style="margin-top:1.5rem"><i class="fas fa-route"></i> Process: Why → How → What</h3>
                <p><strong>Why:</strong> We needed reliable long‑range, low‑power telemetry for outdoor sensing. LoRaWAN via TTN fit the constraints better than Wi‑Fi or cellular for a student prototype.</p>
                <p><strong>How:</strong> I provisioned the device in TTN, confirmed the payload format, subscribed via MQTT on the Raspberry Pi, persisted records in a lightweight local database, and bound the dashboard to live topics.</p>
                <p><strong>What:</strong> A working, repeatable pipeline that streams GPS/TDS/pH/temperature/turbidity to the dashboard with timestamped, stored measurements.</p>

                <h3 style="margin-top:1.5rem"><i class="fas fa-user-check"></i> My Specific Contributions</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Registered device + application in TTN and validated uplinks/downlinks.</li>
                    <li>Defined a clear payload schema and version tag to avoid decode ambiguity later.</li>
                    <li>Configured the MQTT client on Raspberry Pi and mapped topics to storage fields.</li>
                    <li>Designed the DB table structure for time‑series inserts and basic querying.</li>
                    <li>Connected the dashboard to live data and verified end‑to‑end latency.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 style="margin-top:1.5rem"><i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> Key Insights I Gained</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Payload discipline:</strong> Agreeing on units, ranges, and a version flag saves hours of debugging later.</li>
                    <li><strong>MQTT topic hygiene:</strong> Consistent topic paths (e.g., <code>v3/&lt;app-id&gt;@ttn/devices/&lt;device-id&gt;/up</code>) make subscribers simpler and safer.</li>
                    <li><strong>Time is data:</strong> Using gateway‑received timestamps prevents device clock drift from corrupting trends.</li>
                    <li><strong>Signal vs. noise:</strong> pH and turbidity benefit from a small rolling median to reduce spikes without hiding events.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 style="margin-top:1.5rem"><i class="fas fa-balance-scale"></i> Decisions & Trade‑offs</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Chose LoRaWAN for range/power at the cost of low bandwidth — acceptable for compact sensor payloads.</li>
                    <li>Kept storage lightweight on the Pi to prioritize a demonstrable pipeline over heavy analytics.</li>
                    <li>Favored a simple, readable dashboard first; deeper analytics come after data quality is proven.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 style="margin-top:1.5rem"><i class="fas fa-tools"></i> Challenges I Hit (and How I Solved Them)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Topic mismatch:</strong> Initial MQTT subscription missed messages; fixed by matching TTN v3 topic format and application ID.</li>
                    <li><strong>Decode errors:</strong> Byte/hex confusion created wrong TDS values; standardized the decoder and documented units.</li>
                    <li><strong>Noisy readings:</strong> Implemented a small rolling window filter and added sensor warm‑up time before logging.</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <p><strong>Next Steps:</strong> add payload versioning in metadata, per‑sensor calibration records, battery/health telemetry, and alerts for out‑of‑range values. Containerize the Pi services to make deployments reproducible.</p>
                </div>
                <p style="margin-top:1rem"><em>Personal note:</em> I stayed intentionally curious — asking many questions to clarify requirements and to help my peers unblock. I’ll continue documenting my “why → how → what” so the process is as visible as the result.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title"><i class="fas fa-mountain"></i> Exploring Austria</h2>
            <div class="section-content">
                <p>We explored Linz in the first week, walking across bridges and through the city’s shopping streets. We returned to visit the Ars Electronica Center (Future Museum), seeing innovations around AI and emerging technologies.</p>
                <p>On the first weekend we visited Gmunden for a mountain trip, a treetop tour, and lunch at the top — plus a visit to a lakeside church.</p>
                <p>The following weekend we went to Salzburg and hiked in the Austrian Alps, a highlight of the trip. We explored the city, enjoyed glühwein and pretzels, and climbed the fortress steps in the center.</p>
                <p>Hagenburg (Hagenberg) itself was remote, and became my favorite location of the entire minor. The private rooms offered needed quiet, and the surrounding nature was wonderful. The train ride to Belgium was relaxing — until I realized I’d left my laptop bag on the last stretch!</p>
                <p>And that was Austria.</p>
